RunInfo:
  $p p \to \mu^+ \mu^-$+X 8 TeV.
  Needs mass cut on lepton pair to avoid photon singularity,
  restrict $Z/\gamma^*$ mass range to roughly $50~\text{GeV}/c^2 < m_{\mu\mu}
    < 130~\text{GeV}/c^2$ for efficiency.
  Result is corrected for QED FSR (i.e. leptons are dressed), so turn off in generator.

Description:
  Cross section as a function of $p_T$ and y of the Z boson decaying into muons
  in p p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV.  $p_T$ and y cross sections are measured for 
  $60 < m_{\mu\mu} < 120$ GeV.  The $p_T$ cross section is measured for lepton $p_T > 20$ GeV
  and $\eta < 2.1$, while the y cross section is extrapolated to all lepton $p_T$ and $\eta$.
  This measurement was performed using 36 pb$^{-1}$ of data collected during 2010 with 
  the CMS detector at the LHC.
